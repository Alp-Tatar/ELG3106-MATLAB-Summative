# Electromagnetic Engineering Design Study

This project explores the impact of broadband antireflection coatings on solar power generation, conducted as part of ELG 3106 at the University of Ottawa. Leveraging MATLAB for numerical simulations and analytical approaches, the study aims to optimize coating designs to enhance power efficiency.

Key Features:

- Analyze reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves in dielectric media.
- Implement transfer matrix method (TMM) for numerical simulations.
- Explore double-layer and triple-layer antireflection coatings for solar cells.
- Optimize coating parameters to minimize reflectivity and maximize power output.
- Generate comprehensive technical reports showcasing theoretical and computational analyses.
